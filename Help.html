			First, you'll set up tasks that you want to do in your everyday life.
			Then, as you complete the tasks in real life and check them off, you'll earn Experience and Gold.
			Gold is used to buy equipment and some items, as well as custom rewards.
			Experience causes your character to level up and unlock content such as pets, skills, and quests!
		</p>

	<button class="accordion">How do I set up my tasks?</button>

	<div class="panel">
		<p id="paragraph">
			Good Habits (the ones with a heavy_plus_sign) are tasks that you can do many times a day, such as eating vegetables.
			Bad Habits (the ones with a heavy_minus_sign) are tasks that you should avoid, like biting nails.
			Habits with a heavy_plus_sign and a heavy_minus_sign have a good choice and a bad choice, like taking the stairs vs.
			taking the elevator. Good Habits award Experience and Gold. Bad Habits subtract Health.
			Dailies are tasks that you have to do every day, like brushing your teeth or checking your email.
			You can adjust the days that a Daily is due by clicking the pencil item to edit it.
			 If you skip a Daily that is due, your avatar will take damage overnight. Be careful not to add too many Dailies at once!
			To-Dos are your To-Do list. Completing a To-Do earns you Gold and Experience.
			You never lose Health from To-Dos. You can add a due date to a To-Do by clicking the pencil icon to edit.
		</p>
	</div>

		<button class="accordion">Why do my tasks change color?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p id="paragraph">
			Your tasks change color based on how well you are currently accomplishing them! Each new task starts out as a neutral yellow.
			Perform Dailies or positive Habits more frequently and they move toward blue.
			Miss a Daily or give in to a bad Habit and the task moves toward red. The redder a task,
			the more rewards it will give you, but if it’s a Daily or bad Habit, the more it will hurt you!
			This helps motivate you to complete the tasks that are giving you trouble.
		</p>
	</div>

		<button class="accordion">Why did my avatar lose health, and how do I regain it?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<br>
		<p id="paragraph">
			There are several things that can cause you to take damage.
			First, if you left Dailies incomplete overnight and didn't check them off in the screen that popped up the next morning, those unfinished Dailies will damage you.
			Second, if you click a bad Habit, it will damage you.
			Finally, if you are in a Boss Battle with your party and one of your party mates did not complete all their Dailies,
			the Boss will attack you. The main way to heal is to gain a level, which restores all your Health.
			You can also buy a Health Potion with Gold from the Rewards column.
			Plus, at level 10 or above, you can choose to become a Healer, and then you will learn healing skills.
			Other Healers can heal you as well if you are in a Party with them. Learn more by clicking "Party" in the navigation bar.
