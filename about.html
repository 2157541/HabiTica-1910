          Habitica is a game to help you improve real-life habits. The better you are at accomplishing real-life tasks, the more you progress in the game.
        	It "gamifies" your life by giving you in-game rewards for your real-life tasks. Completing your real-life tasks means you can tick off your Habitica tasks. The routine items that must be completed each day are called Dailies. You progress in the game by improving your life and mastering your habits – and should you slip up in life, you'll start to lose health points.
