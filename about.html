	<h1> About Habitica </h1>
  <hr class="new1">
  <br>
	<p> Habitica is a game to help you improve real-life habits. The better you are at accomplishing real-life tasks, the more you progress in the game. 
	It "gamifies" your life by giving you in-game rewards for your real-life tasks. Completing your real-life tasks means you can tick off your Habitica tasks. The routine items that must be completed each day are called Dailies. You progress in the game by improving your life and mastering your habits â€“ and should you slip up in life, you'll start to lose health points.</p>

  <h2> Gamification In Education </h2>
  <p> Education is one of the best sectors for gamification. We all know how glued to phones and games students are these days; harness that power! Pit your students against each other in friendly competition. Reward good behavior with rare prizes. Watch their grades and behavior soar. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Gamification In Health and Wellness </h2>
  <p> Health care costs are on the rise, and something's gotta give. Hundreds of programs are built to reduce costs and improve wellness. We believe Habitica can pave a substantial path towards healthy lifestyles. </p>
